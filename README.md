# Rock Paper Scissors
The third coding project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I think the most frustrating part of this is figuring out how to work out the round mechanism.

I was tempted to add a "try again?" feature, but then the project warned me not to add too many things. I think input validation is more than enough. Teehee.
